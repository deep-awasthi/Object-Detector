# Object-Detection

A complete guide to object detection using YOLO V4, OpenCV and Darknet

This collection of Google Colab Notebook demonstrates how to perform object detection using the YOLO V4 model.

The project is seperated into three sections as listed below:

## Object detection for still image

The trained model will take image from Internet and output the result with objects marked on it.

## Object detection for captured image

The given button will capture the image from the web cam of the device and then the trained model will take image and show output the result with objects marked on it.

## Object detection for real-time image

The object detection will be lagging one frame due to use of Javascript for collecting data from browser and camera.

## Requirements
You need to have a Google account and access to your Google Drive
